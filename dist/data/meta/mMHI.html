<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>The median household income provides an indication of how well people are doing financially in a neighborhood. Lower wage earners may have higher percentages of their income devoted to consumption and less for saving, making them less resilient in economic downturns. Higher wage earners may have more of their income available for consumption and more savings that can enable them to be more resilient in economic downturns. Service providers and retailers look at income levels to help them locate their services.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>The household income at the midpoint of all households. Half of the households in this blockgroup earn a higher annual income and half earn a lower annual income. These amounts are inflation-adjusted for 2011.&lt;br&gt; As with all measurements from the American Community Survey in the Neighborhood Compass, this data represents 5 yearsâ€™ worth of surveying. With each annual update, the 5-year period advances by dropping one year and incorporating the next. For this reason, annual releases of this measurement are not suitable for true time series comparison until no overlap exists among the survey periods.</p>
