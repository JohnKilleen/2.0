<p>Commercial Certificates of Occupancy</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Certificates of occupancy are issued for completed renovations or new construction. Newly completed commercial COs indicate recent investment in real estate (an economic benefit to a neighborhood) and additional new commercial space, which is both an opportunity for local business growth and potential for improved access to core needs and employment.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>COs included here are the following types: business, mercantile, factory industrial, and mixed use commercial. The count of these per neighborhood or blockgroup is divided by the area in square miles within the City/County Inspections districts.</p>
