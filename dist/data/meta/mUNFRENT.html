<p>Gross Rent Over 30% of Income</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>30 percent of monthly or annual household income is widely regarded as the standard beyond which housing is unaffordable. This measure reflects the comparative affordability of rental housing in Durham blockgroups. While this is a stand-alone measurement the cost of daily household transportation has a dynamic relationship with housing location and should also be considered a component of housing affordability.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>Gross rent as a percentage of household income is a computed ratio of monthly gross rent to monthly household income. &lt;br&gt; As with all measurements from the American Community Survey in the Neighborhood Compass, this data represents 5 yearsâ€™ worth of surveying. With each annual update, the 5-year period advances by dropping one year and incorporating the next. For this reason, annual releases of this measurement are not suitable for true time series comparison until no overlap exists among the survey periods.</p>
