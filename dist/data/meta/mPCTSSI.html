<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>

<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>As with all measurements from the American Community Survey in the Neighborhood Compass, this data represents 5 years’ worth of surveying. With each annual update, the 5-year period advances by dropping one year and incorporating the next. For this reason, annual releases of this ACS product are not suitable for true time series comparison until no overlap exists among the survey periods.</p>
