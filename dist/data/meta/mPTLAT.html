<p>Information on race is required for many Federal programs and is critical in making policy decisions, particularly for civil rights. States use these data to meet legislative redistricting principles. Race data also are used to promote equal employment opportunities and to assess racial disparities in health and environmental risks.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>A higher number in this measure reflects both a higher number of race and ethnicity categories present and more people of each race and ethnicity. A diversity measurement of 100 would mean all major race and ethnicity categories are present and equally represented, while a measure of 0 would indicate only one race or ethnicity is present. The calculation of this measurement uses the Simpson Index of Diversity.</p>
