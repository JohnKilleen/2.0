<p>Commuting 30 Minutes or More</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Travel time to work is an economic, environmental and quality of life metric. Economically, this reflects whether workers in a specific area are obligated to travel farther for work and that there are fewer work opportunities near their homes. Environmentally, it indicates whether a specific area contributes more vehicle miles traveled and thereby more polluting auto emissions. Finally, many commuters find longer daily trips burdensome, costly and stressful, leading to a negative impact on quality of life.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>This data includes all those commuting to the workplace, whether in personal vehicles, bicycles, walking or by public transit. As of 2010, the Durham County mean commuting time was 21.7 minutes. &lt;br&gt; As with all measurements from the American Community Survey in the Neighborhood Compass, this data represents 5 yearsâ€™ worth of surveying. With each annual update, the 5-year period advances by dropping one year and incorporating the next. For this reason, annual releases of this measurement are not suitable for true time series comparison until no overlap exists among the survey periods.</p>
