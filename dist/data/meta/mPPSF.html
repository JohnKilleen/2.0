<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Changes in the median price per square foot indicate whether general residential property values are rising, falling, or staying the same. The median value provides a stable metric less subject to skewing by individual values that are either extremely high or extremely low. This information should not be used to determine whether a particular sale value is appropriate, but rather to understand how trends are occurring throughout Durhamâ€™s neighborhoods.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>Residential sales of all types are sourced from Durham County tax records and values are normalized to 2015 dollars using the Consumer Price Index for housing. All normalized sale amounts are divided by the heated square feet of the property and then a median price per square foot for each neighborhood area is calculated. </p>
