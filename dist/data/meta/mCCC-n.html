<p>Foundational stages of brain development that guide behavior and health for years to come occur before age 5. &lt;a href=&#39;http://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/reports_and_working_papers/foundations-of-lifelong-health/&#39; target=&#39;_blank&#39;&gt;Research&lt;a/&gt; has shown that positive, healthful early development environments lead to more resilient brain development and greater flexibility in the acquisition of skills throughout life. Stable, high-quality child care in the early years of child development has life-long implications. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Access to quality care can be compromised by inadequate local facilities or public transit service, challenges posed by neighborhood safety and other environmental or economic factors.</p>
