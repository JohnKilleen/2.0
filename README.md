Neighborhood Compass 2.0 (development).
==========

This branch is an effort to develop options for switching between the current D3 bar chart and other chart options (starting with the js chart already baked in (see http://mcmap.org/qol)).

Durham NC's adaptations of Tobin Bradley's Quality of Life Explorer v2 (https://github.com/tobinbradley/Mecklenburg-County-Quality-of-Life-Dashboard). Changes made here will roll into the Durham Neighborhood Compass (http://compass.durhamnc.gov).
