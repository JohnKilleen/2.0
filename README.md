Neighbrohood Compass 2.0 (development).
==========

This branch is an effort to replace the sequential 1-153 id field for blockgroups with Census geoids. Dependencies are: config.js, census.topo.json, and src/metrics/census. 

Durham NC's adaptations of Tobin Bradley's Quality of Life Explorer v2 (https://github.com/tobinbradley/Mecklenburg-County-Quality-of-Life-Dashboard). Changes made here will roll into the Durham Neighborhood Compass (http://compass.durhamnc.gov).
