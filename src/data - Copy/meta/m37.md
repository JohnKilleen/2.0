## Household Income 
Median household income

### Why is this important?
Household income is the sum of incomes for all inhabitants in a household. It provides an indication of how well households - instead of individual earners - are doing financially, which many service providers and retailers look at to help them locate their services. Incomes are closely related to levels of educational attainment and unemployment rates, and also vary significantly by household type and size, age, race, and ethnicity. Improvements in neighborhood income over time may indicate that residents' incomes have improved, or that a neighborhood's demographic composition has changed, with higher income households moving in or lower income households moving out.

####How are we doing?
As of 2013, the median household income in Mecklenburg County was $54,278, compared to $45,906 in North Carolina and $52,250 in the United States. The Charlotte metropolitan area ranks 23rd out of the 25 most populous metro areas in median household income, though these numbers are not adjusted for regional variations in cost of living. Median household income in Mecklenburg County was $50,579 in 1999, representing a real decline of 30% when adjusting for inflation, ($70,723 in 2013 dollars). This decline reflects two national recessions as well as changing household composition. 

####Did you know?
Median household income is used to determine eligibility for the City of Charlotte's Neighborhood Matching Grants Program. Neighborhoods with a median household income below $61,650 are eligible to apply for up to $25,000 in matching grant funds.

### About the Data
The median household income as estimated in the American Community Survey. Median household income is inflation-adjusted to the most recent year of the five-year estimate. When a Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) is comprised of more than one block group, the median household income is estimated by averaging the median household income in the block groups weighted by the total number of households in each block group. When combining NPAs into larger geographies, this variable should be used with caution.
