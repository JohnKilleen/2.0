## Voter Participation 
Percentage of registered voters that voted in the last general election

### Why is this important?
As an indicator of civic health, voter participation rates reflect democracy in action - the degree to which people exercise individual choices to produce community leaders and collectively influence policies and laws. Voter participation rates vary widely by age, sex, race/ethnicity, income and education. Voting is a measure of engagement, but also an expression of hope, and voter participation is closely linked to voters' level of trust and confidence in politicians and civic institutions.

####How are we doing?
In Mecklenburg County, over 432,000 people voted in the 2012 general election, representing 79% of registered voters compared to 68% across North Carolina. Presidential election years typically see many more voters than in "mid-term," or non-presidential election years, making it difficult to compare participation rates from one election to the next. For example, the national voter participation rate for eligible voters was 61.8% in 2012, and only 45.5% in 2010, a mid-term election.

### About the Data
Number of voters in prior general election divided by the total number of registered voters. The Mecklenburg County Board of Elections maintains current voter registration files according to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and the North Carolina General Statues. However, total registered voters may include people who have moved but not notified the Board of Elections, if they did not vote in the election.
