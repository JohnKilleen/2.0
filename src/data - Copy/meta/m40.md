## Rental Costs
Median gross rent of renter-occupied housing units

### Why is this important?
Gross rent is the contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of all utilities. Many factors determine the rental costs in neighborhoods, including age and size of housing units, home design and condition, proximity to amenities, assigned school zones, and the availability of rental units in each area. Renting provides a flexible and more financially suitable housing option for many households, but the number of renters paying more than 30% of income for housing (the traditional measure of affordability used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development) is at a historic high. A lack of geographically diverse, affordable housing options can force trade-offs in both housing quality and spending on other critical needs such as food, health care and transportation.

####How are we doing?
Median gross rent has climbed steadily in Mecklenburg County, from $792 in 2007 to $875 in 2012. The number of renters who are housing cost-burdened has also increased, as has the total number of renters. In 2012, 46% of renter households were cost-burdened (paying more than 30% of income on housing) and 24% of renter households were severely cost-burdened (paying more than 50% of income on housing). While some households choose to pay a higher percentage of income on housing, many low- and moderate-income households are constrained by a lack of affordable housing options.

####Did you know?
The fair market rent for a 2-bedroom apartment in Mecklenburg County is $813. At minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, a person would have to work 2.2 jobs to afford this apartment, using HUD's affordability threshold of 30% of income.

### About the Data
The median gross rent of renter-occupied housing units as estimated in the American Community Survey. When a Neighborhood Profile Area is comprised of more than one block group, the median gross rent is estimated by averaging the median gross rent in the block groups weighted by the total number of rental units in each block group. Areas with fewer than 50 rental units are not included. Rental costs are in 2012 dollars.
