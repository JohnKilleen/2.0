## Housing Age
Average age of single-family housing units 

### Why is this important?
The age of housing generally reflects the development history of the county - Charlotte's oldest neighborhoods are closer to the center city and may be nearly 100 years old, while new neighborhoods continue to be built across the county. A decrease in average age in an area may indicate in-fill or redevelopment in an older neighborhood, or large numbers of new houses constructed on previously undeveloped land. 

The average housing age may also provide an indication of the condition or character of a neighborhood's housing stock. Typically, older houses need higher levels of repair and maintenance, but offer opportunities for affordable rehabilitation or renovation and investment. A group of older homes may have historic significance or be classified as a local or national historic district. A group of newer homes is more likely to be organized around private amenities such as common areas, playgrounds, or pools. Offering a diverse mix of housing in cost, age, size, style, amenities and neighborhood settings is important to meet the needs and preferences of all residents. 

####Did you know?

### About the Data
The age of each single-family housing structure (year of data collection minus year structure built) is summed and divided by the total number of single-family housing structures. Single-family includes single-family detached units, duplexes, triplexes, and mobile homes, though each structure is counted only once regardless of the number of units within it.
