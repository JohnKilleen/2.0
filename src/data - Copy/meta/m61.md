## Calls for Animal Control
Animal control calls per 1,000 residents 

### Why is this important?
Animal control laws in the county are in place to ensure both humane treatment of animals and a safe and clean community. Many factors affect the number of animal control calls in an area, such as the density of residents, the number of animals owned, proximity to undeveloped land, and the diligence of residents - both animal owners and not. Maintaining a safe environment is possible by promoting responsible pet ownership, decreasing the overpopulation of domestic pets through spay-neuter programs, placing adoptable animals in good homes, and following safety precautions around wildlife such as raccoons, coyotes and geese. 

####How are we doing?
The county-wide totals are not comparable over time periods due to the addition and subtraction of town data. However, trend data are available for areas that have data in multiple time periods. 

####Did you know?
In fiscal 2013, The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department's Animal Care and Control Division accepted 16,473 animals into its shelters and adopted out 2,359 cats and dogs.
