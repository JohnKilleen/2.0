## Library Card Holders
Percentage of population with an active library card

### Why is this important?
Libraries foster literacy and learning, provide an open civic space, and promote education and economic development. Mecklenburg County's library system offers books and e-books, music and videos, homework assistance, and a variety of programs and activities for all ages, from story time to writing contests to job and technology training programs. In addition, the computers, internet and printers found at the library are a critical resource for users who lack these technological resources at home.

####How are we doing?
In fiscal year 2014, the 20 library locations in Mecklenburg County were visited over 3 million times and lent nearly 6 million items. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Library websites were visited more than 27 million times, and over 273,000 digital items were downloaded - a 22% increase from the previous year. In all, 900,000 reference questions were answered, and more than 317,000 people attended library programs. 

Of the 150,635 active library card holders in 2013, 137,171 had addresses that could be matched to a household within Mecklenburg County.

####Did you know?
According to the 2014 Charlotte Citizen Survey, 7 of Charlotteans used public libraries or their services twice a week or more, 20% 2-4 times a month, and 37% at least once a year. Nationally, 72% of Americans say they live in a "library household," according to the Pew Research Center.

### About the Data 
Active library card holders (used at least once in the last year) divided by total population. 

Note: Data for this variable at the NPA level are derived using individual address-level records that must be precisely located to exact addresses. It is not uncommon to have 1% to 4% of records not able to be included due to record formatting errors or the addition and subtractions of streets and housing units.
