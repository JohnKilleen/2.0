## Commercial Space
Average square footage of commercial space per parcel

### Why is this important?
Commercial space reflects the intensity of commercial development and is an indicator of economic activity in an area. Whether the building is a high-rise, a large manufacturing facility, or a corner shop, the area available for workers and machinery to be productive gives an indication of the potential economic output. Building size and use can also impact the amount of infrastructure and services required to maintain and operate the buildings, from the size of water, telecommunications and electric connections to the amount of parking and administrative support. Though there are distinct commercial districts and business and industrial parks throughout the county, many businesses are established to serve the surrounding neighborhoods and residents, with commercial buildings woven into the community fabric.
