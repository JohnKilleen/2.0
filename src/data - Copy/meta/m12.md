## Population - Youth
Percentage of the population under the age of 18

### Why is this important?
As the Charlotte area grows and changes, neighborhoods can experience large demographic changes over short periods of time. The youth population is especially dynamic, and also tends to be more diverse. Shifts in the youth population can change demand for services such as schools, child care, out-of-school time programs, and family support programs, and increase demand for certain housing types and retail goods.

####How are we doing?
The youth population in Mecklenburg County was 24.8% in 2013, similar to North Carolina (23.2%) and the United States (23.3%). Between 2000 and 2010, the youth population in the Charlotte metro area grew by almost 33%, the 4th highest of the nation's largest metros. The pace of growth slowed somewhat during the economic recession, but overall the number of children has continued to rise, from 238,987 in 2011 to 245,521 in 2013. Key regional factors that influence growth in the youth population include economic growth, housing affordability, lower population density, and growing immigrant populations.
