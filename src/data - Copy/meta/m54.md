## Births to Adolescents
Percentage of births to females under 19

### Why is this important?
The high social and economic costs of teen pregnancy and childbearing can have short- and long-term consequences for teen parents, their children, and the community. Children of teen parents are more likely to struggle in school, be incarcerated, live in poverty, and even become teen parents themselves. Reducing rates of births to adolescents can improve future trends in health, education, and the economy. Many community factors are related to adolescents' choices and hopes for the future. Safe neighborhoods, effective schools, opportunities for structured out-of-school time activities, access to health care and health education, and employment opportunities can all influence behavior and may reduce the number of births to adolescents.

####How are we doing?
The percentage of births to adolescents declined from 4.7% of all births in 2010-2011 to 3.5% of all births in 2012-13. The teen birth rate in Mecklenburg County in 2013 was 24.1 per 1,000, compared to 28.4 per 1,000 in North Carolina and 29.4 per 1,000 in the United States. Despite long-term declines since 1991, teen pregnancy and birth rates remain much higher in the United States than in other developed nations, and cost US taxpayers more than $9 billion each year.

####Did you know?
According to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 45% of high school students report ever having had sexual intercourse, and 12% report using no method of birth control to prevent pregnancy.
