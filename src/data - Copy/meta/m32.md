## Nuisance Violations
Nuisance violations per 100 housing units

### Why is this important?
Nuisance violations include offenses such as high weeds/grass, accumulation of trash or junk, junk or abandoned automobiles, dilapidated condition, and illegal dumping. Maintaining a clean and orderly environment improves health and safety, promotes neighborhood pride, increases property values, and creates a sense of mutual ownership and maintenance between residents. Tracking nuisance violations can assist neighborhoods and residents in identifying repeated problems and developing strategies to address them. Increases in nuisance violations may signify increased nuisance, but may also show signs of increased neighborhood engagement and concern, or reflect community improvement through focused enforcement efforts.

#### Did you know?
High grass or weeds and trash or junk violations encompass more than half of all nuisance violations.
