## Vacant Land
Percentage of land area that is classified as vacant

### Why is this important?
Land that is undeveloped or otherwise empty of any taxable structure is becoming scarce in Mecklenburg County. As the population grows, more housing and services are needed to support the influx of new people and growing businesses, all of which require space. Change in the percentage of vacant land reflects the pace of growth.

Existing vacant land ranges from small parcels nested in the heart of urban neighborhoods to large tracts of land outside of city limits. No matter where the land is located, however, zoning regulations are in place to guide future developments. While developing land adds to its value and increases the local tax base, development must be balanced with the preservation of land for natural areas and open space.

####How are we doing?
Mecklenburg County is projected to reach build-out by 2025. As of 2013, 18.2% of land in Mecklenburg County was classified as vacant. Land development and construction slowed during the economic recession, and some land slated for development was instead purchased and preserved. Mecklenburg County's 2008 Park & Recreation Master Plan called for 9,747 acres of land to be acquired by 2018 for parks and nature preserves. As of 2014, approximately 1,000 acres of land had been acquired, just 10% of the goal. 

####Did you know?
Mecklenburg County developed acreage per person is 0.23, only slightly higher than the national metro area average of 0.22 acres per person.

### About the Data
Total area of tax parcels classified as vacant divided by total land area. Vacant land was classified as part of an existing land use survey conducted by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department through a variety of sources including tax data, building codes, existing datasets (e.g., parks, daycare locations, threatened agriculture), aerial imagery, and field verification.
