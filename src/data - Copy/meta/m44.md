##Transit Ridership
Average weekly bus and train boardings per available route

### Why is this important?
Public transportation systems can provide affordable, safe and equitable access to work, home, education, food, health services, social activities and more. Public transportation usage, particularly as an alternative to driving, may also provide health benefits such as increasing physical activity, reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, reduced fatalities and injuries and greater social cohesion. A variety of factors impact transit ridership including stop proximity and service frequency, transit cost and hours of operation, vehicle ownership and parking availability, traffic congestion levels, employment rate and employment density, and more. 
  
####How are we doing?
According to Sustain Charlotte, transit ridership using the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) more than doubled from an average of 44,014 riders per day in 2000 to 92,134 in 2012. Even when accounting for population growth over this same period, ridership increased an average of 4% per year from 633 to 994 riders per 10,000 residents. 

According to the National Transit Database, the Charlotte metro area ranks 64th out of 290 urban areas in transit trips per capita, at 20.9, more than Raleigh, NC (7.2) but fewer than Atlanta, GA (29.9). 
In 2013, 3.3% of commuters in Mecklenburg County traveled regularly by public transportation, compared to 1.1% in North Carolina and 5.2% nationally. 

####Did you know
The LYNX Blue Line Light-Rail accounts for approximately 17% of the 27.8 million CATS trips annually.
