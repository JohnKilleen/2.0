## Commercial Construction
Concentration of commercial building permits per 100 acres

### Why is this important?
New and renovated commercial space is an indicator of where business investment and growth is occurring in the community. Increased commercial activity can impact neighborhoods in both positive and negative ways. The upfit and maintenance of existing buildings and the addition of new commercial structures expands the capacity of businesses to serve surrounding neighborhoods and increases employment opportunities. However, commercial construction activity may also lead to tensions due to concerns over traffic, parking, and the displacement of traditional businesses as neighborhoods change over time. 

####How are we doing?
Commercial construction slowed during the economic recession as did residential construction. In fiscal year 2013, there were 493 commercial building permits in Mecklenburg County, a decrease from 669 in fiscal year 2011.
