## Population - Older Adult
Percentage of the population age 65 and over

### Why is this important?   
The number of adults age 65 and over continues to rise as the large "Baby Boomer" generation (those born between 1946 and 1964) reaches retirement age. As this generation ages, neighborhoods can experience large demographic changes over short periods of time. Shifts in the older adult population can change demand for recreational and social service programs, transit and para-transit, neighborhood infrastructure, health care, and housing types that both remain affordable on fixed incomes and allow aging in place. 

####How are we doing?
The older adult population in Mecklenburg County was 9.7% in 2013, significantly lower than North Carolina (14.3%) and the United States (14.1%). At 35 years, Mecklenburg County has the youngest median age in the 14-county Charlotte region. However, the number of older adults continues to rise, from 59,724 in 2000 to 81,113 in 2010, an increase of 35%.

####Did you know?
According to a study from the AARP, the amenities that older adults prefer to have close to home (within one mile) are bus stops, grocery stores, parks, and pharmacies.
