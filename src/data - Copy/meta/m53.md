## Rental Houses
Percentage of detached single-family dwellings that are rentals

### Why is this important?
Rental housing provides a flexible and financially suitable housing option for households, particularly in times of economic recession or housing market decline. A large share of rental houses may reflect the general decline in homeownership rates, the enduring impacts of the foreclosure crisis, or may represent longer patterns of neighborhood disinvestment. Areas with large shares of rental houses may provide opportunities for reinvestment and the creation of affordable homeownership. Percentage of rented properties should be analyzed with other data such as the age and condition of the homes, house size and design, adjacent land uses, and area incomes.

####Did you know?
As the homeownership rate has fallen in the U.S., single-family homes have captured a large portion of growth in renter-occupied units. From 2005 to 2011, single-family units as a share of the renter-occupied stock grew from 30.8% to 33.5%.

### About the Data
The number of detached, single-family rental houses divided by the total number of detached, single-family houses. 

Houses are considered rentals if the owner mailing address in the tax records does not match the property address. Homeowners who utilize a P.O. Box or other business address for tax records may be misrepresented with this methodology. Areas with fewer than 5 single-family units are suppressed and represented as N/A. The Town of Davidson is suppressed due to the high percentage of properties utilizing a P.O. Box.
