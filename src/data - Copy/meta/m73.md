## Neighborhood Organizations
Number of neighborhood organizations registered with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Department

### Why is this important?
An active neighborhood organization is a key component of community health, safety, and stability. Residents working together can solve local problems, influence local decisions, maintain community standards and social control, and create a welcoming and connected network of neighbors. Registered organizations are utilized as an information-sharing outlet for government staff, and serve as a way to gather input and feedback from neighborhoods across the county. Also, grants and other community building opportunities are more readily available for organizations with active residents working on behalf of their neighborhood. 

####Did you know? 
According to the Corporation for National and Community Service, 11% of people in the Charlotte region report being active in their neighborhoods, compared to just 8% nationally. However, just 40% of people in the Charlotte region report trusting most or all of the people in their neighborhood, a much lower percentage than North Carolina (53%) and the U.S. (67%), and lagging other cities in the region such as Raleigh (63%) and Atlanta (58%).
