Racial & Ethnic Diversity

### Why is this important?
Diversity is a deeply valued component of our community, reflecting our mutual human rights and values, and equal access to opportunity for people of all races and ethnicities. Research on race and ethnic diversity has shown that it influences social solidarity, social trust, and tolerance among other aspects of community life.

### About the Data
The percent of the total population reporting their race to be White and ethnicity as not Latino or Hispanic. Ethnicity is a separate characteristic from race and individuals reporting their ethnicity to be Latino or Hispanic may also report a race description such as White or African American.
