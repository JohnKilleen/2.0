Population Density 

### Why is this important?
Population density indicates the number of people living in a selected boundary divided by the area (in square miles) of the boundary. Density of population helps the City, County and other service providers know where infrastructure and other services are used most. Businesses might use population density to understand where markets exist for goods and services.

### About the Data
This measurement provides the population per square mile based on the 2010 Census using blockgroups. The Neighborhood Compass will report 100% population counts from the 2010 Decennial Census until population estimates for blockgroups are available through the American Community Survey (ACS) for 2010-2014. Annual population updates will then be made from the ACS until the 2020 Decennial Census.
