### About the Data
Reported by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data is one of the only reliable sources of lending patterns at the neighborhood level. Along with understanding the valuation of loans (seen here), it reports demographics and household income of mortgage applicants, whether a mortgage is originated, and whether it is for investment or owner-occupancy.
