## Sidewalk-to-Roadway Ratio
Sidewalk-to-Roadway Ratio

### Why is this important?
This ratio indicates how well-served an area is by sidewalks. The ratio is to be read as the number of sidewalk feet for every hundred feet of roadway in a neighborhood. If the number is more than 100, it is likely due to sidewalks existing on both sides of many neighborhood streets.

### About the Data
The intention of this measurement is to indicate how well neighborhood roads serve pedestrians. Pedestrian or bike paths not adjacent to roadways are not among the sidewalks counted here. Areas reporting 'N/A' are outside City limits and do not contain annexed communities - the City does not maintain or build sidewalks in those areas.
