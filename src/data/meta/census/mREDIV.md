## Racial & Ethnic Diversity
Racial & Ethnic Diversity

### Why is this important?
Diversity is a deeply valued component of our community, reflecting our mutual human rights and values, and equal access to opportunity for people of all races and ethnicities. Research on race and ethnic diversity has shown that it influences social solidarity, social trust, and tolerance among other aspects of community life.

### About the Data
A higher number in this measure reflects both a higher number of race and ethnicity categories present and more people of each race and ethnicity. A diversity measurement of 1 would mean all major race and ethnicity categories are present and equally represented, while a measure of 0 would indicate only one race or ethnicity is present. The calculation of this measurement uses the Simpson Index of Diversity.
