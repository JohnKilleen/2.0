Households Within Walking Distance to Full Service Grocers

### Why is this important?
Grocery stores are among the core services a community needs, providing reliable access to basic foods: dry goods, meat, fresh produce, and dairy. Neighborhoods without easy access to grocers are transportation-dependent for core needs, leading to higher costs of living and reliance on inadequate convenience food sources.

### About the Data
Grocery stores include chain groceries and independent full-service stores. These are identified primarily by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 44511. The 1/4 mile distance is Euclidean, or as-the-crow-flies.
