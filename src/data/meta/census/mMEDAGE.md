## Median Age
Median Age

### Why is this important?
The median age is used to indicate the age of the population in general. Communities with higher numbers of aging residents may face different challenges than others and might require enhanced services or physical infrastructure.

### About the Data
The age at the midpoint of the population. Half of the population is older than this age, and half is younger. 

As with all measurements from the American Community Survey in the Neighborhood Compass, this data represents 5 years' worth of surveying. With each annual update, the 5-year period advances by dropping one year and incorporating the next. For this reason, annual releases of this measurement are not suitable for true time series comparison until no overlap exists among the survey periods.
