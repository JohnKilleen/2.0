## Households Within Walking Distance to Banks
Households Within Walking Distance to Banks

### Why is this important?
Banking is a core community service, providing financial planning, savings, and management services to households. Neighborhoods without easy access to such core services are transportation dependent for primary needs, leading to higher costs of living and reliance on inadequate convenience services.

### About the Data
This measurement includes both commercial bank locations and credit unions. These are identified primarily by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 52211 and 52213. The 1/4 mile distance is Euclidean, or as-the-crow-flies.
